<h1>Home</h1>
<p>We want to state that the security in our program is not that good, since you can fetch some of the data<br/>
    Without the need authorisation and also - since this it the first time we are making a project from that<br/>
    scale some of the code could be useless or mixed in illogical way, we apologize for that.</p>
<p>Our website represents a 'store page' where you can buy items. An admin can login so that he/she can add new<br/>
    products to a database or check and edit created orders. A customer can login so that she/he can order <br/>
    different products which should be handled by the administrators afterwards.</p>
<p>However, our program is small - we should admin that there are a lot more stuff TODO in order to have a<br/>
    working "BUY-SELL" website. I guess this is good enough and it's showing what we learnt during this semester</p>
Namaste!<br/>
